# end to end sign-language communication
This repository is about end to end communication between physically hearing impairment(person1) and outer world(person2).

from person1 to person2:
<br>
1.person 2 records the video of signs generated by person1.
<br>
2.the video is split into frames and body poses are taken from the frames. 
<br>
3.from body points and locations we map the sign gloss.
<br>
4.from sign gloss to english is translated through NLP techniques.

from person2 to person1:
<br>
1.person 1 records the english text generated by person2.
<br>
2.the english words are then translated to sign gloss using NLP techniques.
<br>
3.body points are generated from sign gloss.
<br>
4.Using  GAN video is generated.
