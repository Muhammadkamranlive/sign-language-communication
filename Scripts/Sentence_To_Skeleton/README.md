# End to End Sign-Language Communication
This repository is about end to end communication between physically hearing impairment(person1) and outer world(person2).

from person2 to person1:
<br>
1.person 1 records the english text generated by person2.
<br>
2.the english words are then translated to sign gloss using NLP techniques.
<br>
3.body points are generated from sign gloss.
<br>
4.Using  GAN video is generated.
<br>



## FILES ##
<br>
boston_preprocessing.py -- Writes a CSV file consisting of the sentence and respective video of each word in gloss.<br>
<br>
openpose.py -- extracts the skeleton frames from the frames of the video and stores in new file.<br>
<br>
dwt_boston104.py -- Dynamic time wrapping of wrists is done and a CSV file is made consisting of word and skeleton locations.<br>
<br>
training of gans are shown in https://github.com/saisriteja/sign-language-communication/blob/master/Scripts/Sentence_To_Skeleton/sign_language_sentence_to_video_generation.ipynb.
<br>


## NLP techniques output ##
The results I achieved below are taken dataset from phenoix weather dataset for sign langauge by using Luong's attension based mechanism.
