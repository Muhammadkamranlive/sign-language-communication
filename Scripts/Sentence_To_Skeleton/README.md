# End to End Sign-Language Communication
This repository is about end to end communication between physically hearing impairment(person1) and outer world(person2).


from person2 to person1:
<br>
1.person 1 records the english text generated by person2.
<br>
2.the english words are then translated to sign gloss using NLP techniques.
<br>
3.body points are generated from sign gloss.
<br>
4.Using  GAN video is generated.
<br>

## NLP techniques output ##
The results I achieved below are taken dataset from phenoix weather dataset for sign langauge by using Luong's attension based mechanism.
